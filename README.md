Baileys does not require Selenium or any other browser to be interface with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a **WebSocket**. 
Not running Selenium or Chromimum saves you like **half a gig** of ram :/ 
Baileys supports interacting with the multi-device & web versions of WhatsApp.

1. ``` cd path/to/Baileys ```
2. ``` yarn ```
3. ``` yarn example ```

## Install

Use the stable version:
```
yarn add @whiskeysockets/baileys
```

Use the edge version (no guarantee of stability, but latest fixes + features)
```
yarn add github:WhiskeySockets/Baileys
```

Then import your code using:
``` ts 
import makeWASocket from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'
```

## Unit Tests

TODO

## Connecting multi device (recommended)

WhatsApp provides a multi-device API that allows Baileys to be authenticated as a second WhatsApp client by scanning a QR code with WhatsApp on your phone.

``` ts
import makeWASocket, { DisconnectReason } from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'
import { Boom } from '@hapi/boom'

async function connectToWhatsApp () {
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        // can provide additional config here
        printQRInTerminal: true
    })
    sock.ev.on('connection.update', (update) => {
        const { connection, lastDisconnect } = update
        if(connection === 'close') {
            const shouldReconnect = (lastDisconnect.error as Boom)?.output?.statusCode !== DisconnectReason.loggedOut
            console.log('connection closed due to ', lastDisconnect.error, ', reconnecting ', shouldReconnect)
            // reconnect if not logged out
            if(shouldReconnect) {
                connectToWhatsApp()
            }
        } else if(connection === 'open') {
            console.log('opened connection')
        }
    })
    sock.ev.on('messages.upsert', m => {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(m, undefined, 2))

        console.log('replying to', m.messages[0].key.remoteJid)
        await sock.sendMessage(m.messages[0].key.remoteJid!, { text: 'Hello there!' })
    })
}
// run in main file
connectToWhatsApp()
``` 

If the connection is successful, you will see a QR code printed on your terminal screen, scan it with WhatsApp on your phone and you'll be logged in!

## Configuring the Connection

You can configure the connection by passing a `SocketConfig` object.

The entire `SocketConfig` structure is mentioned here with default values:
``` ts
type SocketConfig = {
    /** the WS url to connect to WA */
    waWebSocketUrl: string | URL
    /** Fails the connection if the socket times out in this interval */
        connectTimeoutMs: number
    /** Default timeout for queries, undefined for no timeout */
    defaultQueryTimeoutMs: number | undefined
    /** ping-pong interval for WS connection */
    keepAliveIntervalMs: number
    /** proxy agent */
        agent?: Agent
    /** pino logger */
        logger: Logger
    /** version to connect with */
    version: WAVersion
    /** override browser config */
        browser: WABrowserDescription
        /** agent used for fetch requests -- uploading/downloading media */
        fetchAgent?: Agent
    /** should the QR be printed in the terminal */
    printQRInTerminal: boolean
    /** should events be emitted for actions done by this socket connection */
    emitOwnEvents: boolean
    /** provide a cache to store media, so does not have to be re-uploaded */
    mediaCache?: NodeCache
    /** custom upload hosts to upload media to */
    customUploadHosts: MediaConnInfo['hosts']
    /** time to wait between sending new retry requests */
    retryRequestDelayMs: number
    /** max msg retry count */
    maxMsgRetryCount: number
    /** time to wait for the generation of the next QR in ms */
    qrTimeout?: number;
    /** provide an auth state object to maintain the auth state */
    auth: AuthenticationState
    /** manage history processing with this control; by default will sync up everything */
    shouldSyncHistoryMessage: (msg: proto.Message.IHistorySyncNotification) => boolean
    /** transaction capability options for SignalKeyStore */
    transactionOpts: TransactionCapabilityOptions
    /** provide a cache to store a user's device list */
    userDevicesCache?: NodeCache
    /** marks the client as online whenever the socket successfully connects */
    markOnlineOnConnect: boolean
    /**
     * map to store the retry counts for failed messages;
     * used to determine whether to retry a message or not */
    msgRetryCounterMap?: MessageRetryMap
    /** width for link preview images */
    linkPreviewImageThumbnailWidth: number
    /** Should Baileys ask the phone for full history, will be received async */
    syncFullHistory: boolean
    /** Should baileys fire init queries automatically, default true */
    fireInitQueries: boolean
    /**
     * generate a high quality link preview,
     * entails uploading the jpegThumbnail to WA
     * */
    generateHighQualityLinkPreview: boolean

    /** options for axios */
    options: AxiosRequestConfig<any>
    /**
     * fetch a message from your store
     * implement this so that messages failed to send (solves the "this message can take a while" issue) can be retried
     * */
    getMessage: (key: proto.IMessageKey) => Promise<proto.IMessage | undefined>
}
```

### Emulating the Desktop app instead of the web

1. Baileys, by default, emulates a chrome web session
2. If you'd like to emulate a desktop connection (and receive more message history), add this to your Socket config:
    ``` ts
    const conn = makeWASocket({
        ...otherOpts,
        // can use Windows, Ubuntu here too
        browser: Browsers.macOS('Desktop'),
        syncFullHistory: true
    })
    ```

## Saving & Restoring Sessions

You obviously don't want to keep scanning the QR code every time you want to connect. 

So, you can load the credentials to log back in:
``` ts
import makeWASocket, { BufferJSON, useMultiFileAuthState } from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'
import * as fs from 'fs'

// utility function to help save the auth state in a single folder
// this function serves as a good guide to help write auth & key states for SQL/no-SQL databases, which I would recommend in any production grade system
const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState('auth_info_baileys')
// will use the given state to connect
// so if valid credentials are available -- it'll connect without QR
const conn = makeWASocket({ auth: state }) 
// this will be called as soon as the credentials are updated
conn.ev.on ('creds.update', saveCreds)
```

**Note:** When a message is received/sent, due to signal sessions needing updating, the auth keys (`authState.keys`) will update. Whenever that happens, you must save the updated keys (`authState.keys.set()` is called). Not doing so will prevent your messages from reaching the recipient & cause other unexpected consequences. The `useMultiFileAuthState` function automatically takes care of that, but for any other serious implementation -- you will need to be very careful with the key state management.

## Listening to Connection Updates

Baileys now fires the `connection.update` event to let you know something has updated in the connection. This data has the following structure:
``` ts
type ConnectionState = {
        /** connection is now open, connecting or closed */
        connection: WAConnectionState
        /** the error that caused the connection to close */
        lastDisconnect?: {
                error: Error
                date: Date
        }
        /** is this a new login */
        isNewLogin?: boolean
        /** the current QR code */
        qr?: string
        /** has the device received all pending notifications while it was offline */
        receivedPendingNotifications?: boolean 
}
```

**Note:** this also offers any updates to the QR

## Handling Events

Baileys uses the EventEmitter syntax for events. 
They're all nicely typed up, so you shouldn't have any issues with an Intellisense editor like VS Code.

The events are typed as mentioned here:

``` ts

export type BaileysEventMap = {
    /** connection state has been updated -- WS closed, opened, connecting etc. */
        'connection.update': Partial<ConnectionState>
    /** credentials updated -- some metadata, keys or something */
    'creds.update': Partial<AuthenticationCreds>
    /** history sync, everything is reverse chronologically sorted */
    'messaging-history.set': {
        chats: Chat[]
        contacts: Contact[]
        messages: WAMessage[]
        isLatest: boolean
    }
    /** upsert chats */
    'chats.upsert': Chat[]
    /** update the given chats */
    'chats.update': Partial<Chat>[]
    /** delete chats with given ID */
    'chats.delete': string[]
    'labels.association': LabelAssociation
    'labels.edit': Label
    /** presence of contact in a chat updated */
    'presence.update': { id: string, presences: { [participant: string]: PresenceData } }

    'contacts.upsert': Contact[]
    'contacts.update': Partial<Contact>[]

    'messages.delete': { keys: WAMessageKey[] } | { jid: string, all: true }
    'messages.update': WAMessageUpdate[]
    'messages.media-update': { key: WAMessageKey, media?: { ciphertext: Uint8Array, iv: Uint8Array }, error?: Boom }[]
    /**
     * add/update the given messages. If they were received while the connection was online,
     * the update will have type: "notify"
     *  */
    'messages.upsert': { messages: WAMessage[], type: MessageUpsertType }
    /** message was reacted to. If reaction was removed -- then "reaction.text" will be falsey */
    'messages.reaction': { key: WAMessageKey, reaction: proto.IReaction }[]

    'message-receipt.update': MessageUserReceiptUpdate[]

    'groups.upsert': GroupMetadata[]
    'groups.update': Partial<GroupMetadata>[]
    /** apply an action to participants in a group */
    'group-participants.update': { id: string, participants: string[], action: ParticipantAction }

    'blocklist.set': { blocklist: string[] }
    'blocklist.update': { blocklist: string[], type: 'add' | 'remove' }
    /** Receive an update on a call, including when the call was received, rejected, accepted */
    'call': WACallEvent[]
}
```

You can listen to these events like this:
``` ts

const sock = makeWASocket()
sock.ev.on('messages.upsert', ({ messages }) => {
    console.log('got messages', messages)
})

```

## Implementing a Data Store

Baileys does not come with a defacto storage for chats, contacts, or messages. However, a simple in-memory implementation has been provided. The store listens for chat updates, new messages, message updates, etc., to always have an up-to-date version of the data.

It can be used as follows:

``` ts
import makeWASocket, { makeInMemoryStore } from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'
// the store maintains the data of the WA connection in memory
// can be written out to a file & read from it
const store = makeInMemoryStore({ })
// can be read from a file
store.readFromFile('./baileys_store.json')
// saves the state to a file every 10s
setInterval(() => {
    store.writeToFile('./baileys_store.json')
}, 10_000)

const sock = makeWASocket({ })
// will listen from this socket
// the store can listen from a new socket once the current socket outlives its lifetime
store.bind(sock.ev)

sock.ev.on('chats.upsert', () => {
    // can use "store.chats" however you want, even after the socket dies out
    // "chats" => a KeyedDB instance
    console.log('got chats', store.chats.all())
})

sock.ev.on('contacts.upsert', () => {
    console.log('got contacts', Object.values(store.contacts))
})

```

The store also provides some simple functions such as `loadMessages` that utilize the store to speed up data retrieval.

**Note:** I highly recommend building your own data store especially for MD connections, as storing someone's entire chat history in memory is a terrible waste of RAM.

## Sending Messages

**Send all types of messages with a single function:**

### Non-Media Messages

``` ts
import { MessageType, MessageOptions, Mimetype } from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'

const id = 'abcd@s.whatsapp.net' // the WhatsApp ID 
// send a simple text!
const sentMsg  = await sock.sendMessage(id, { text: 'oh hello there' })
// send a reply messagge
const sentMsg  = await sock.sendMessage(id, { text: 'oh hello there' }, { quoted: message })
// send a mentions message
const sentMsg  = await sock.sendMessage(id, { text: '@12345678901', mentions: ['12345678901@s.whatsapp.net'] })
// send a location!
const sentMsg  = await sock.sendMessage(
    id, 
    { location: { degreesLatitude: 24.121231, degreesLongitude: 55.1121221 } }
)
// send a contact!
const vcard = 'BEGIN:VCARD\n' // metadata of the contact card
            + 'VERSION:3.0\n' 
            + 'FN:Jeff Singh\n' // full name
            + 'ORG:Ashoka Uni;\n' // the organization of the contact
            + 'TEL;type=CELL;type=VOICE;waid=911234567890:+91 12345 67890\n' // WhatsApp ID + phone number
            + 'END:VCARD'
const sentMsg  = await sock.sendMessage(
    id,
    { 
        contacts: { 
            displayName: 'Jeff', 
            contacts: [{ vcard }] 
        }
    }
)

const reactionMessage = {
    react: {
        text: "💖", // use an empty string to remove the reaction
        key: message.key
    }
}

const sendMsg = await sock.sendMessage(id, reactionMessage)
```

### Sending messages with link previews

1. By default, WA MD does not have link generation when sent from the web
2. Baileys has a function to generate the content for these link previews
3. To enable this function's usage, add `link-preview-js` as a dependency to your project with `yarn add link-preview-js`
4. Send a link:
``` ts
// send a link
const sentMsg  = await sock.sendMessage(id, { text: 'Hi, this was sent using https://github.com/adiwajshing/baileys' })
```

### Media Messages

Sending media (video, stickers, images) is easier & more efficient than ever. 
- You can specify a buffer, a local url or even a remote url.
- When specifying a media url, Baileys never loads the entire buffer into memory; it even encrypts the media as a readable stream.

``` ts
import { MessageType, MessageOptions, Mimetype } from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'
// Sending gifs
await sock.sendMessage(
    id, 
    { 
        video: fs.readFileSync("Media/ma_gif.mp4"), 
        caption: "hello!",
        gifPlayback: true
    }
)

await sock.sendMessage(
    id, 
    { 
        video: "./Media/ma_gif.mp4", 
        caption: "hello!",
        gifPlayback: true,
        ptv: false // if set to true, will send as a `video note`
    }
)

// send an audio file
await sock.sendMessage(
    id, 
    { audio: { url: "./Media/audio.mp3" }, mimetype: 'audio/mp4' }
    { url: "Media/audio.mp3" }, // can send mp3, mp4, & ogg
)
```

### Notes

- `id` is the WhatsApp ID of the person or group you're sending the message to. 
    - It must be in the format ```[country code][phone number]@s.whatsapp.net```
            - Example for people: ```+19999999999@s.whatsapp.net```. 
            - For groups, it must be in the format ``` 123456789-123345@g.us ```. 
    - For broadcast lists, it's `[timestamp of creation]@broadcast`.
    - For stories, the ID is `status@broadcast`.
- For media messages, the thumbnail can be generated automatically for images & stickers provided you add `jimp` or `sharp` as a dependency in your project using `yarn add jimp` or `yarn add sharp`. Thumbnails for videos can also be generated automatically, though, you need to have `ffmpeg` installed on your system.
- **MiscGenerationOptions**: some extra info about the message. It can have the following __optional__ values:
    ``` ts
    const info: MessageOptions = {
        quoted: quotedMessage, // the message you want to quote
        contextInfo: { forwardingScore: 2, isForwarded: true }, // some random context info (can show a forwarded message with this too)
        timestamp: Date(), // optional, if you want to manually set the timestamp of the message
        caption: "hello there!", // (for media messages) the caption to send with the media (cannot be sent with stickers though)
        jpegThumbnail: "23GD#4/==", /*  (for location & media messages) has to be a base 64 encoded JPEG if you want to send a custom thumb, 
                                    or set to null if you don't want to send a thumbnail.
                                    Do not enter this field if you want to automatically generate a thumb
                                */
        mimetype: Mimetype.pdf, /* (for media messages) specify the type of media (optional for all media types except documents),
                                    import {Mimetype} from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'
                                */
        fileName: 'somefile.pdf', // (for media messages) file name for the media
        /* will send audio messages as voice notes, if set to true */
        ptt: true,
        /** Should it send as a disappearing messages. 
         * By default 'chat' -- which follows the setting of the chat */
        ephemeralExpiration: WA_DEFAULT_EPHEMERAL
    }
    ```
## Forwarding Messages

``` ts
const msg = getMessageFromStore('455@s.whatsapp.net', 'HSJHJWH7323HSJSJ') // implement this on your end
await sock.sendMessage('1234@s.whatsapp.net', { forward: msg }) // WA forward the message!
```

## Reading Messages

A set of message keys must be explicitly marked read now. 
In multi-device, you cannot mark an entire "chat" read as it were with Baileys Web.
This means you have to keep track of unread messages.

``` ts
const key = {
    remoteJid: '1234-123@g.us',
    id: 'AHASHH123123AHGA', // id of the message you want to read
    participant: '912121232@s.whatsapp.net' // the ID of the user that sent the  message (undefined for individual chats)
}
// pass to readMessages function
// can pass multiple keys to read multiple messages as well
await sock.readMessages([key])
```

The message ID is the unique identifier of the message that you are marking as read. 
On a `WAMessage`, the `messageID` can be accessed using ```messageID = message.key.id```.

## Update Presence

``` ts
await sock.sendPresenceUpdate('available', id) 

```
This lets the person/group with ``` id ``` know whether
